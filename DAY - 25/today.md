## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Aggressive Cows Problem

Day 25 was dedicated to solving the **Aggressive Cows Problem**. This is another classic application of the "Binary Search on the Answer" pattern, but with a twist. Instead of minimizing a maximum (like in the Book Allocation problem), the goal here is to **maximize a minimum** distance.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about adapting the binary search on the answer pattern to a maximization problem.

1.  **Aggressive Cows Problem:**
    -   **Approach:** The problem asks to find the largest possible minimum distance between any two cows. This structure is a perfect fit for **Binary Search on the Answer**.
    -   **Search Space:** After sorting the stall positions, the range of possible minimum distances is from `0` to `(last_stall_position - first_stall_position)`.
    -   **Predicate Function (`isPossibleSol`):** A helper function was created to check if it's possible to place all `cows` with at least a `mid` distance between them. It works greedily: place the first cow at the first stall, then iterate through the remaining stalls, placing the next cow only when the distance from the previously placed cow is greater than or equal to `mid`. If all cows can be placed, `mid` is a possible distance.
    -   **Binary Search Logic:**
        -   If `isPossibleSol(mid)` is `true`, it means `mid` is a valid minimum distance. We store it as a potential answer and try to find an even better (larger) solution by searching in the right half (`start = mid + 1`).
        -   If `isPossibleSol(mid)` is `false`, it means the `mid` distance is too large and cannot be achieved. We must search for a smaller distance in the left half (`end = mid - 1`).

_A great session solidifying the binary search on the answer pattern, this time for a maximization problem!_
