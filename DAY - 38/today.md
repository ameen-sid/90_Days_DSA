## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: PRATA - SPOJ

Day 38 was dedicated to solving another classic competitive programming problem, **PRATA from SPOJ**. This problem is a perfect example of a **minimization problem** that can be solved efficiently using the "Binary Search on the Answer" strategy, reinforcing the concepts from the past few days.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about applying the binary search on the answer pattern to a problem involving rates and time.

1.  **PRATA - SPOJ:**
    -   **Approach:** The problem asks for the minimum time required for a group of cooks to make a specific number of pratas. This is a classic **Binary Search on the Answer** problem.
    -   **Search Space:** The range of possible answers for the minimum time is from `0` to a calculated upper bound. The upper bound is the time it would take the slowest cook to make all the pratas alone.
    -   **Predicate Function (`isPossibleSol`):** A helper function was created to determine if a given `mid` (a potential answer for the minimum time) is feasible. For each cook, the function calculates how many pratas they can make within the `mid` time limit (considering the time to cook each subsequent prata increases: R, 2R, 3R, etc.). If the total number of pratas made by all cooks is greater than or equal to the required amount, then `mid` is a possible time.
    -   **Binary Search Logic:**
        -   If `isPossibleSol(mid)` is `true`, it means the task can be completed within `mid` time. We store this as a potential answer and search for an even better (smaller) time in the left half (`end = mid - 1`).
        -   If `isPossibleSol(mid)` is `false`, the time `mid` is not sufficient. We must search for a larger time in the right half (`start = mid + 1`).

_Excellent work applying the binary search on the answer pattern to a more complex scenario with non-linear time calculations!_
