## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Exploring C++ Pre-defined String Functions

Day 75 was dedicated to learning and practicing the powerful, pre-defined member functions of the C++ `std::string` class. This session focused on moving from manual, C-style character array manipulation to using the efficient and safe methods provided by the Standard Template Library (STL).

## âœ… Progress Summary

-   **Topics Covered:** C++ `std::string` member functions.
-   **Primary Language:** C++

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was a tour of the most common and useful string functions:

-   **Accessors:** Practiced using `.length()`, `.empty()`, `.at()`, `.front()`, and `.back()` to get information and elements from a string.
-   **Modifiers:** Explored functions that alter the string, including:
    -   `.append()`: To concatenate strings.
    -   `.erase()`: To remove a portion of the string.
    -   `.insert()`: To add characters at a specific position.
    -   `.push_back()` & `.pop_back()`: To add/remove a character from the end.
-   **Search & Compare:** Learned how to use:
    -   `.find()`: To locate the starting position of a substring.
    -   `.compare()`: To perform a case-sensitive comparison between two strings.
    -   `.substr()`: To extract a new string from a portion of the original.

_A great session on leveraging the STL to write cleaner, more powerful, and less error-prone string manipulation code._
