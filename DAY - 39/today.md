## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: C++ STL - Array and Vector

Day 39 was dedicated to learning the fundamentals of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL), starting with two of the most common sequence containers: **`std::array`** and **`std::vector`**. The session focused on understanding their characteristics, member functions, and use cases.

## âœ… Progress Summary

-   **Topics Covered:** C++ STL `std::array` and `std::vector`.
-   **Primary Language:** C++

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was a deep dive into the features and differences between C++'s static and dynamic array containers.

1.  **`std::array`:**

    -   **Concept:** Understood that `std::array` is a container that encapsulates fixed-size arrays. Unlike C-style arrays, it's a class that provides several member functions.
    -   **Key Functions Practiced:**
        -   `.size()`: To get the number of elements.
        -   `.at()`: For safe, bounds-checked access to elements.
        -   `.empty()`: To check if the array is empty.
        -   `.front()` & `.back()`: To access the first and last elements respectively.

2.  **`std::vector`:**
    -   **Concept:** Learned that `std::vector` is a dynamic array that can automatically resize itself. This is one of the most versatile and commonly used containers in the STL.
    -   **Key Functions & Properties Practiced:**
        -   **`capacity()` vs. `size()`**: Differentiated between the allocated storage (`capacity`) and the number of actual elements (`size`).
        -   **`push_back()`**: To add an element to the end of the vector.
        -   **`pop_back()`**: To remove the last element.
        -   **`clear()`**: To remove all elements from the vector (reducing size to 0).
        -   **Initialization**: Practiced various ways to initialize a vector, including with a specific size and default value, and by copying another vector.

_A great foundational day on the C++ STL that will be critical for all future data structures._
