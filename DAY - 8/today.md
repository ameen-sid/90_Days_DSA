## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Understanding Algorithm Efficiency

Day 8 was a crucial theoretical day, dedicated entirely to understanding **Time and Space Complexity**. This foundational topic is essential for analyzing the efficiency of algorithms and is a primary focus in technical interviews.

All the key concepts and notes from today's study session have been compiled into the `timeComplexity.md` file.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

Today's session was focused on building the theoretical framework needed to write efficient code:

-   **Why Complexity Matters:** Understood the importance of analyzing algorithms to manage limited resources and write high-performance code.
-   **Asymptotic Notations:** Learned about Big O (Upper Bound), Theta (Average Case), and Omega (Lower Bound) as the standard units for representing complexity.
-   **Complexity Classes:** Familiarized with the hierarchy of common complexities, from O(1) (Constant) to O(n!) (Factorial), and their implications based on input size.
-   **Practical Application:** Studied the time complexity constraints typically seen in competitive programming and technical assessments to quickly identify the required efficiency for a given problem.
