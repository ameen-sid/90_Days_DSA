## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: C++ STL - Deque and List

Day 40 continued the exploration of C++ STL sequence containers, focusing on **`std::deque`** (double-ended queue) and **`std::list`** (doubly-linked list). The session was dedicated to understanding their unique internal structures and the performance characteristics that result.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was a deep dive into two more powerful STL containers, highlighting their specific use cases.

1.  **`std::deque` (Double-Ended Queue):**

    -   **Concept:** Understood that a `deque` is like a `vector` but with the added ability to perform efficient insertions and deletions at **both the beginning and the end** of the container.
    -   **Key Functions Practiced:**
        -   **`push_front()` / `pop_front()`**: To add/remove elements from the front.
        -   **`push_back()` / `pop_back()`**: To add/remove elements from the back.
        -   **`at()`**: For random access to elements.
        -   **`erase()`**: To remove elements from a specific range.

2.  **`std::list` (Doubly-Linked List):**
    -   **Concept:** Learned that `std::list` is implemented as a doubly-linked list, where each element stores pointers to the previous and next elements. This structure allows for constant-time insertion and deletion anywhere in the list, but it does not support fast random access (like `at()` or `[]`).
    -   **Key Functions Practiced:**
        -   **`push_front()` / `push_back()`**: To add elements to either end.
        -   **`erase()`**: To efficiently remove elements from any position using an iterator.
        -   **`size()`**: To get the number of elements in the list.

_A great session on understanding the trade-offs between different STL sequence containers!_
