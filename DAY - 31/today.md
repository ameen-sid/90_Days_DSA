## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Introduction to Sorting Algorithms - Bubble Sort

Day 31 marked the beginning of a new and crucial topic: **Sorting Algorithms**. The session started with one of the most fundamental sorting techniques, **Bubble Sort**, to build an understanding of comparison-based sorting.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about understanding the mechanics of a simple, albeit inefficient, sorting algorithm.

1.  **Bubble Sort:**
    -   **Approach:** The classic **Bubble Sort** algorithm was implemented using a **nested loop**.
        -   The outer loop runs `n-1` times to ensure that every element is placed in its correct final position.
        -   The inner loop iterates through the unsorted part of the array, comparing adjacent elements (`nums[j]` and `nums[j+1]`). If the elements are in the wrong order, they are swapped.
    -   This process effectively "bubbles" the largest unsorted element to its correct position at the end of the array in each pass of the outer loop. The algorithm has a time complexity of `O(N^2)`.

_A great start to sorting algorithms with a clear, foundational example!_
