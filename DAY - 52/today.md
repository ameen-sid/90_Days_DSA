## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Checking for Palindromes

Day 52 continued with C-style strings by tackling the classic problem of checking if a string is a palindrome.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session reinforced the two-pointer technique for string manipulation.

1.  **Check String is Palindrome or Not:**
    -   **Approach:** The efficient **Two-Pointer technique** was used. A `start` pointer at the beginning of the string and an `end` pointer at the end move towards each other. In each step, the characters at both pointers are compared. If a mismatch is ever found, the string is not a palindrome. If the pointers cross without any mismatches, the string is confirmed to be a palindrome.

_Great job staying consistent. Every problem solved is a step forward!_
