## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Simple String Replacement

Day 72 was a back-to-basics session, focusing on a fundamental string manipulation task: replacing all occurrences of a specific character (`@`) with a space.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about implementing a straightforward, in-place character replacement.

1.  **Replace @ with Space:**
    -   **Approach:** The solution uses a simple **linear scan** of the string. It iterates through each character, and if the character is `'@'`, it is replaced directly with a space (`' '`). This is an efficient, in-place modification with a time complexity of `O(N)`.
