## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Binary Search on the Answer - Book Allocation

Day 23 was dedicated to solving the classic **Book Allocation Problem**. This is a prime example of the "Binary Search on the Answer" pattern, where the search space is not an array but a range of potential solutions. This problem is a significant step up in applying binary search to complex optimization scenarios.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was focused on identifying and implementing the "Binary Search on the Answer" strategy to find an optimal solution.

1.  **Book Allocation Problem:**
    -   **Approach:** The problem asks to minimize the maximum number of pages allocated to any student. This structure is a clear indicator for **Binary Search on the Answer**.
    -   **Search Space:** The range of possible answers is from `0` (minimum possible pages) to the `sum of all pages` in the books array (maximum possible pages).
    -   **Predicate Function (`isPossibleSol`):** A helper function was created to check if a given value `mid` (a potential answer for the maximum pages) is a valid allocation for `M` students. This function works greedily: it allocates books to a student until the next book would exceed the `mid` limit, at which point it moves to the next student. If it can allocate all books to `M` or fewer students, the `mid` value is a possible solution.
    -   **Binary Search Logic:**
        -   If `isPossibleSol(mid)` is `true`, it means `mid` is a valid allocation. We store it as a potential answer and try to find an even better (smaller) solution by searching in the left half (`end = mid - 1`).
        -   If `isPossibleSol(mid)` is `false`, it means `mid` is too small, and we need to allow for more pages. We search in the right half (`start = mid + 1`).

_A fantastic session on a very important binary search pattern. This approach is key for many optimization problems._
