## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Converting String to Uppercase

Day 64 was a back-to-basics session on string manipulation, focusing on the fundamental task of converting a string to uppercase in-place.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session focused on character manipulation using ASCII values.

1.  **Convert String to Uppercase:**
    -   **Approach:** The solution iterates through the string character by character. For each character, it checks if it falls within the ASCII range of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`). If it does, it converts the character to its uppercase equivalent by subtracting the ASCII value of `'a'` and adding the ASCII value of `'A'`. This is an efficient, in-place modification with a time complexity of `O(N)`.

_A solid session on a fundamental string operation!_
