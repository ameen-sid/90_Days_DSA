## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Sum of Two Arrays

Day 48 was dedicated to solving the **Sum of Two Arrays** problem. This challenge involves treating two arrays as representations of large integers and calculating their sum, which is then returned in a new array.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session focused on simulating manual, grade-school addition using an array-based approach.

1.  **Sum of Two Arrays:**
    -   **Approach:** The problem was solved using a **two-pointer technique**, starting from the end of both arrays.
        -   Pointers `i` and `j` traverse `arr1` and `arr2` from right to left. In each step, the corresponding digits are added along with a `carry` from the previous step.
        -   The last digit of the `sum` is pushed into the result array, and the `carry` is calculated for the next iteration.
        -   The process continues in separate loops for any remaining digits in the longer of the two arrays.
        -   Finally, the result array is reversed to get the correct order of digits. This method efficiently handles the addition in `O(max(n, m))` time.

_A great session on a classic problem that reinforces digit manipulation and the two-pointer technique._
