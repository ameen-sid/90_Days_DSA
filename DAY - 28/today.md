## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Matrix Multiplication

Day 28 was dedicated to implementing the fundamental operation of **Matrix Multiplication**. This is a core concept in linear algebra and a common problem that requires a solid understanding of nested loops and 2D array indexing.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session focused on the standard algorithm for multiplying two matrices.

1.  **Matrix Multiplication:**
    -   **Approach:** The standard **brute-force algorithm** was implemented using a **triply nested loop**.
        -   The outer two loops iterate through each row `i` of the first matrix (A) and each column `j` of the second matrix (B) to determine the position of the element to be calculated in the resultant matrix.
        -   The innermost loop iterates through the columns `k` of matrix A (which is equal to the rows of matrix B). It calculates the dot product by summing the products of `A[i][k]` and `B[k][j]`.
    -   The algorithm also includes a check to ensure that the multiplication is possible (i.e., the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second).
