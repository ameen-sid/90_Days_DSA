## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

Today's session rounded out the study of number systems by tackling the remaining conversion paths. The key takeaways include:

-   **Handling Hexadecimal Characters:** Gained experience in programmatically converting hexadecimal characters (A-F) to their corresponding decimal values and vice-versa, as seen in `Hexadecimal_to_Decimal.cpp`.
-   **Intermediate Conversions:** Mastered the technique of using an intermediate base (like Decimal or Binary) to simplify complex conversions, such as `Octal_to_Hexadecimal.cpp`.
-   **Comprehensive Understanding:** By completing all 12 conversion types across Day 6 and Day 7, a thorough and practical understanding of number systems has been established.
