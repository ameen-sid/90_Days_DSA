## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Revisiting "Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String"

Day 76 was dedicated to revisiting the **Remove All Adjacent Duplicates** problem. This session focused on reinforcing the stack-based logic for efficiently solving this string manipulation challenge.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about reinforcing a common and efficient string processing pattern.

1.  **Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String:**
    -   **Approach:** The problem was solved again using a **string to simulate a stack**. The algorithm iterates through the input string `s`.
        -   If the result string (`ans`) is not empty and its last character matches the current character from `s`, the last character is popped from `ans`.
        -   Otherwise, the current character from `s` is pushed onto the `ans` string.
    -   This single-pass `O(N)` approach correctly handles all adjacent duplicates.

_A great session reinforcing a key string problem and its optimal solution!_
