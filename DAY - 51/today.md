## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Introduction to C-Style Strings

Day 51 marked the beginning of a new topic: **Strings**. The session started with the fundamentals of handling C-style character arrays, focusing on two of the most basic and essential operations: finding the length and reversing the string.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about understanding the low-level mechanics of null-terminated strings.

1.  **Find Length of String:**

    -   **Approach:** A simple **iterative scan** was implemented. The function iterates through the character array using a `for` loop, incrementing a counter until it encounters the null terminator character (`\0`), which marks the end of a C-style string.

2.  **Reverse a String:**
    -   **Approach:** The classic **Two-Pointer technique** was used for an efficient, in-place reversal. A `start` pointer was initialized to the beginning of the string and an `end` pointer to the last character (before the null terminator). The characters at these pointers were swapped, and the pointers were moved towards the center until they crossed.
