# DSA Challenge: Day 1 Highlights

**Date:** February 5, 2024

## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Mastering Patterns

Day 1 was dedicated to building a strong logical foundation by solving a variety of pattern-printing problems using C++. This is a crucial first step for understanding loops, nested structures, and problem decomposition.

---

## âœ… Progress Summary

-   **Total Problems Solved:** 25
-   **Primary Language:** C++

---

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

The problems in the `Patterns` folder cover a wide range of shapes and logic, including:

-   Simple square and rectangle patterns.
-   Right-angled and equilateral triangles (both upright and inverted).
-   Number, character, and symbol-based patterns.
-   Hollow shapes and diamond patterns.
-   Complex symmetrical and asymmetrical designs.

Each file, like `Pattern-1.cpp`, contains the solution to a specific pattern problem.

_A solid start to the 90-day challenge! Looking forward to Day 2._
