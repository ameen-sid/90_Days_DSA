## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Number Theory & Bit Manipulation with Functions

Day 5 continued to build on the practical use of functions by applying them to a new set of challenges. The focus expanded to include fundamental number theory concepts (like prime numbers and palindromes) and an introduction to bit manipulation.

## âœ… Progress Summary

-   **Total Problems Solved:** 9
-   **Primary Language:** C++

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

Today's session involved applying functions to solve a diverse range of problems, which helped in understanding:

-   **Algorithmic Thinking:** Developing logic for classic problems like checking for prime numbers (`Given_No_Is_Prime_or_Not.cpp`), generating Fibonacci series (`Print_Fibonacci_Series_Till_Nth_Term.cpp`), and finding palindromes (`Find_No_Is_Palindrome_or_Not.cpp`).
-   **Bit Manipulation:** Gained initial experience with bitwise operations to solve problems efficiently, such as counting set bits (`Count_All_Set_Bits_of_a_Number.cpp`) and finding the complement of an integer (`Complement_to_Base_10_Integer.cpp`).
-   **Problem Decomposition:** Reinforcing the skill of breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable functions.

_Great work tackling a wider variety of problems and dipping into bit manipulation!_
