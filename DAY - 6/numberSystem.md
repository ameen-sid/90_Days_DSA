# <center>Number System</center>

A number system is a systematic way of expressing numbers using a set of symbols and rules for representing numerical values. Different number systems are used in various contexts, and they vary based on the base or radix of the system.

### 1. Decimal Number System (Base 10):

The decimal number system is the one most commonly used by humans. It is a base-10 system, meaning it uses ten digits (0 to 9). Each digit's place value is a power of 10.

**_Example:_** 427<sub>10</sub> is a decimal number where
4 is in the hundreds place, 2 is in the tens place, and 7 is in the units place.

### 2. Binary Number System (Base 2):

The binary number system uses only two digits: 0 and 1. It is commonly used in computing and digital electronics, where bits represent binary digits.

**_Example:_** 1011<sub>2</sub> is a binary number where 1 is in the 8s place, 0 is in the 4s place, 1 is in the 2s place, and 1 is in the 1s place, equivalent to the decimal number 11<sub>10</sub>

### 3. Octal Number System (Base 8):

The octal number system uses eight digits: 0 to 7. It is less common but is still used in some programming contexts.

**_Example:_** 53<sub>8</sub> is an octal number where 5 is in the 8s place, and 3 is in the 1s place, equivalent to the decimal number 43<sub>10</sub>

### 4. Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16):

The hexadecimal number system uses sixteen digits: 0 to 9 and A to F (representing 10 to 15). It is often used in computing for concise representation of binary-coded values.

**_Example:_** 2A<sub>16</sub> is a hexadecimal number where 2 is in the 16th place, A (which is equivalent to 10 in decimal) is in the 1s place, equivalent to the decimal number 42<sub>10</sub>
