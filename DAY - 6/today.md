## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Number System Conversions

Day 6 was dedicated to understanding the fundamentals of different **Number Systems** and implementing the logic to convert between them. This is a crucial topic for low-level data representation and a common theme in technical interviews.

A detailed theoretical guide was created in `numberSystem.md` to support the practical coding exercises.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

Today's session involved both theory and practical implementation, solidifying the understanding of:

* **Core Number Systems:** Gained a clear understanding of Binary (Base 2), Octal (Base 8), Decimal (Base 10), and Hexadecimal (Base 16) as detailed in the notes.
* **Conversion Algorithms:** Implemented the logic to programmatically convert numbers between different bases, such as `Decimal_to_Binary.cpp` and `Binary_to_Hexadecimal.cpp`.
* **Mathematical Foundations:** Reinforced the mathematical principles behind place values and base conversions, which are essential for problem-solving.
