## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Painter's Partition Problem

Day 24 was dedicated to solving the **Painter's Partition Problem**, which is structurally identical to the Book Allocation problem. This session served to solidify the "Binary Search on the Answer" pattern, demonstrating its application in a slightly different context to find an optimal minimum-of-maximums solution.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session reinforced the pattern for solving optimization problems where the answer lies within a monotonic search space.

1.  **Painter's Partition Problem:**
    -   **Approach:** The problem asks to minimize the maximum time any single painter works. This is a classic **Binary Search on the Answer** problem.
    -   **Search Space:** The range of possible answers for the minimum time is from `0` to the `sum of all board lengths`.
    -   **Predicate Function (`isPossibleSol`):** A helper function was created to determine if a potential answer `mid` (representing the maximum time any painter can work) is feasible. It greedily assigns boards to a painter until the next board would exceed the `mid` time limit, then moves to the next painter. If all boards can be painted by `K` or fewer painters, `mid` is a possible solution.
    -   **Binary Search Logic:** The main function performs a binary search on the time range. If `isPossibleSol(mid)` is `true`, it means a solution is possible with `mid` as the maximum time, so we store it and search for a smaller time in the left half (`end = mid - 1`). If it's `false`, `mid` is too restrictive, and we must search for a larger time in the right half (`start = mid + 1`).

_Excellent work recognizing and applying the same powerful pattern to a new problem!_
