## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: The Boolean Matrix Problem

Day 27 was dedicated to solving the **Boolean Matrix Problem**. The challenge is to modify a given binary matrix such that if any cell `(i, j)` contains a `1`, its entire row `i` and column `j` are set to `1`.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session focused on solving the problem efficiently without modifying the matrix while iterating through it, which would lead to incorrect results.

1.  **Boolean Matrix:**
    -   **Approach:** An efficient **two-pass approach using auxiliary space** was implemented.
        -   **Phase 1: Marking:** The algorithm first iterates through the entire matrix. Two boolean arrays, `row_marker` and `col_marker`, are used to keep track of which rows and columns contain at least one `1`.
        -   **Phase 2: Modification:** After the initial pass, the algorithm iterates through the matrix again. It uses the information from the marker arrays to update the cells. If `row_marker[i]` or `col_marker[j]` is `true`, the cell `matrix[i][j]` is set to `1`. This prevents the premature modification of the matrix and ensures the correct final state.

_A great session on a common matrix problem that highlights the importance of using auxiliary data structures to store state before making modifications._
