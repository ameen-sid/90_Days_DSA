## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Getting Back on Track - Convert String to Lowercase

Day 70 marked a return to the challenge after a necessary health break. The session focused on a fundamental string manipulation task: converting a string to lowercase in-place.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about easing back into coding with a foundational string problem.

1.  **Convert String to Lowercase:**
    -   **Approach:** The solution iterates through the string and, for each character, checks if it's an uppercase letter. If it is, the character is converted to its lowercase equivalent using ASCII arithmetic: `(ch - 'A') + 'a'`. This is an efficient, in-place modification with a time complexity of `O(N)`.
