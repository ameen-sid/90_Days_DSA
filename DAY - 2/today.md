## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Advanced Patterns & Consolidation

Day 2 continued the deep dive into pattern-based problems, tackling more complex and intricate designs. The primary goal was to solidify the logic of nested loops and prepare for more advanced topics.

A key achievement today was the creation of the `patterns.md` file, which serves as a visual library of all the patterns solved so far.

## âœ… Progress Summary

-   **Total Problems Solved:** 27 (Patterns 26 through 52)
-   **Primary Language:** C++
-   **Key Deliverable:** Created a consolidated `patterns.md` file to visually document all solved patterns.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

Today's session focused on more advanced pattern logic, including:

-   Complex symmetrical shapes.
-   Hollow and filled diamond variations.
-   Alphabetical and numerical sequences in intricate layouts.
-   Pascal's triangle and other mathematical patterns.

The solutions are available in the `Patterns` folder, and the visual output for each can be viewed in the `patterns.md` file.

_Great consistency! Consolidating the patterns is a great way to review. On to Day 3!_
