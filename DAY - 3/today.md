# DSA Challenge: Day 3 Highlights

## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Core C++ Concepts

Day 3 marked a shift from logical patterns to the foundational concepts of C++. The focus was on understanding how data is manipulated at a low level through **Type Casting** and **Bitwise Operators**.

To solidify this knowledge, detailed notes and examples were created in two new files: `typeCasting.md` and `bitwiseOperators.md`.

## âœ… Progress Summary

* **Topics Covered:** Type Casting (Implicit & Explicit), Bitwise Operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, Left Shift, Right Shift).
* **Primary Language:** C++
* **Key Deliverables:**
    * Created a comprehensive guide to **Type Casting** in `typeCasting.md`.
    * Created a detailed breakdown of **Bitwise Operators** in `bitwiseOperators.md`.
    * Wrote a practical C++ program demonstrating Type Casting (`Type_Casting.cpp`).

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

* **Type Casting:** Understood the difference between automatic (implicit) and manual (explicit) type conversions and their importance in preventing data loss and ensuring correct arithmetic operations.
* **Bitwise Operations:** Gained insight into manipulating data at the bit level, a crucial skill for optimization, low-level programming, and solving certain algorithmic problems efficiently.

*A productive day focused on building a strong theoretical foundation. Ready to apply these concepts!*
