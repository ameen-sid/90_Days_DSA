## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Practical Problem-Solving with Functions

Day 4 transitioned from theoretical concepts to practical application by focusing on **Functions**. The goal was to understand how to break down problems into smaller, reusable blocks of code, improving modularity and readability.

A detailed overview of function syntax and usage was documented in `functions.md`.

## âœ… Progress Summary

-   **Total Problems Solved:** 9
-   **Primary Language:** C++
-   **Key Deliverable:** Created a foundational guide to **Functions** in `functions.md`.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings

Today's session was dedicated to applying the concept of functions to solve a variety of common programming problems. This practice helped solidify the understanding of:

-   **Code Reusability:** Writing a single function for tasks like calculating a factorial (`Find_Factorial_of_a_Number.cpp`) and reusing it to solve more complex problems (`Binomial_Coefficient.cpp`).
-   **Modularity:** Encapsulating specific logic, such as unit conversions (`Convert_KM_to_Miles.cpp`) or mathematical formulas (`Find_Area_of_Circle.cpp`), into distinct functions.
-   **Abstraction:** Hiding the complexity of a task behind a simple function call, making the main program logic easier to follow.

_Excellent progress in applying functions to real problems. This will be a critical skill for all future topics._
