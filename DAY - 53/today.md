## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Reversing Words in a String

Day 53 continued with C-style string manipulation, focusing on the problem of reversing each word in a sentence in-place.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session focused on breaking down the problem and reusing a known pattern.

1.  **Reverse Words:**
    -   **Approach:** The solution uses a **two-level reversal** strategy.
        1.  **Word Identification:** A main loop iterates through the string to identify the boundaries of each word, using spaces (`' '`) and the null terminator (`'\0'`) as delimiters.
        2.  **In-place Word Reversal:** For each word identified, a helper function is called. This helper function implements the classic **Two-Pointer technique** to reverse only the characters within that specific word's boundaries.

_Excellent work applying a familiar algorithm as a helper to solve a more complex problem!_
