## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: Valid Palindrome II

Day 78 was dedicated to solving **Valid Palindrome II**, a more advanced version of the classic palindrome problem. The challenge is to determine if a string can become a palindrome by deleting at most one character.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session focused on extending the two-pointer technique to handle a "one-off" error condition.

### 1. Valid Palindrome II

-   **Approach:** The solution uses a modified **Two-Pointer technique**.
    -   Two pointers, `i` and `j`, start from the ends of the string and move inward.
    -   If the characters `s[i]` and `s[j]` match, the pointers are simply moved.
    -   If a mismatch occurs, the string can still be a valid palindrome if either the substring from `i+1` to `j` (skipping the character at `i`) OR the substring from `i` to `j-1` (skipping the character at `j`) is a palindrome.
    -   The algorithm then calls a helper palindrome-checking function on both of these substrings. If either one returns `true`, the original string is considered valid.

_A great session on a problem that requires thinking about alternative success paths when a simple check fails._
