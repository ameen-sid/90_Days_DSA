## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: C++ STL - Set and Map

Day 43 was dedicated to learning about two fundamental associative containers in the C++ STL: **`std::set`** and **`std::map`**. The session focused on understanding how they store elements in a sorted order and provide efficient lookups, insertions, and deletions.

## âœ… Progress Summary

-   **Topics Covered:** C++ STL `std::set` and `std::map`.
-   **Primary Language:** C++

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about understanding containers that automatically maintain a sorted order and ensure uniqueness.

1.  **`std::set`:**

    -   **Concept:** Understood that a `set` is a container that stores **unique** elements in a **sorted** order. It is highly optimized for checking if an element is present in the collection.
    -   **Key Functions Practiced:**
        -   **`insert()`**: To add an element. The set automatically handles duplicates, so inserting an existing element has no effect.
        -   **`erase()`**: To remove an element.
        -   **`count()`**: To check for the presence of an element (will return 0 or 1).
        -   **`find()`**: To get an iterator to a specific element.

2.  **`std::map`:**
    -   **Concept:** Learned that a `map` is a container that stores elements as **key-value pairs**. The keys are unique and are always kept in a sorted order.
    -   **Key Functions Practiced:**
        -   **`[]` operator & `insert()`**: To add or access key-value pairs.
        -   **`erase()`**: To remove an element by its key.
        -   **`count()`**: To check if a key exists in the map.
        -   **`find()`**: To get an iterator to an element with a specific key.

_A great session on two of the most powerful and commonly used data structures in the C++ STL!_
