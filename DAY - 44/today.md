## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: C++ STL Algorithms

Day 44 was dedicated to exploring the powerful, built-in functions available in the C++ `<algorithm>` library. The session focused on understanding and using some of the most common and useful STL algorithms, which provide optimized implementations for frequent tasks like searching, sorting, and manipulation.

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about leveraging the power of the STL to write cleaner and more efficient code.

1.  **STL Algorithms Practiced:**
    -   **`binary_search`**: A function that efficiently checks if an element exists in a **sorted** range.
    -   **`lower_bound`**: Returns an iterator to the first element in a sorted range that is not less than a given value.
    -   **`upper_bound`**: Returns an iterator to the first element in a sorted range that is greater than a given value.
    -   **`max` & `min`**: Simple utility functions to find the maximum or minimum of two values.
    -   **`swap`**: To exchange the values of two variables.
    -   **`reverse`**: To reverse the order of elements within a container.
    -   **`rotate`**: To perform a left rotation on the elements in a container.
    -   **`sort`**: A highly optimized sorting algorithm (typically IntroSort) to sort elements in a range.
