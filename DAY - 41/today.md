## ðŸŽ¯ Today's Focus: C++ STL - Stack and Queue

Day 41 was dedicated to learning about two fundamental container adaptors in the C++ STL: **`std::stack`** and **`std::queue`**. The session focused on understanding their underlying principles (LIFO and FIFO) and their simple, restricted interfaces.

## âœ… Progress Summary

-   **Topics Covered:** C++ STL `std::stack` and `std::queue`.
-   **Primary Language:** C++

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings & Approaches

Today's session was about understanding two of the most important abstract data types in computer science and their STL implementations.

1.  **`std::stack` (LIFO):**

    -   **Concept:** Understood that a `stack` is a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** container. It operates like a stack of plates, where you can only add or remove items from the top.
    -   **Key Functions Practiced:**
        -   **`push()`**: To add an element to the top of the stack.
        -   **`pop()`**: To remove the top element.
        -   **`top()`**: To access the top element without removing it.
        -   **`size()`** & **`empty()`**: To check the number of elements and if the stack is empty.

2.  **`std::queue` (FIFO):**
    -   **Concept:** Learned that a `queue` is a **First-In, First-Out (FIFO)** container. It works like a real-world queue or line, where the first person to join is the first person to be served.
    -   **Key Functions Practiced:**
        -   **`push()`**: To add an element to the back of the queue.
        -   **`pop()`**: To remove the element from the front of the queue.
        -   **`front()`**: To access the front element without removing it.
        -   **`size()`** & **`empty()`**: To check the number of elements and if the queue is empty.

_A great session on two essential data structures that are fundamental to many algorithms._
